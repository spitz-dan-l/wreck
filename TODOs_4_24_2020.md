Parser ConsumeSpec - ability to eliminate gaps when building using list-style.

World apply_command - hold onto an update_thread closure to prevent repeat calls to pre(). This can be done transparently using a cache.

Knowledge base abstraction to map arbitrary gists to arbitrary fragments of story
    Update - this seems to be working quite well in practice.
    
    TODO: Use gist patterns for get(), get_entry(), get_entries() and update()

    The "current limitations" have not become an issue in practice. [1] is basically a non-issue.

    For [2] it may be worthwhile to limit knowledge updates to a subset of the possible ops and queries.

    For [3] we should just fix this. Consolidate() should get all the update stages and basically apply them one stage at a time, bottom-up.
    
    current limitations:
        1 can't represent an *empty* fragment which gets populated via *updates*, instead have to *ingest* the initial contents of the fragment directly.
        2 update() and consolidate() are really cool, but will probably not work for all replace, remove, insert_after ops, or queries that involve path() or key() (though this latter part is not surprising)
            - the same semantics that apply to the root story node apply to each entry in the knowledgebase. So it is illegal at runtime to replace, remove or insert things after them.
        3 during consolidation, updates are applied in a potentially different order than the stages would dictate - all of a child's stages are applied before starting on the parent.

How would-effects should work
    Update- the data structure for representing unapplied story updates now supports this. Still have to actually code the logic for displaying and undoing the would-effects on the frontend side.

    They shouldn't just be implicit. When you specify story updates you specify the would-effects at the same time as you specify the ops. So when compiling story updates you produce 2 things- the staged real effects, and the single-staged would-effects. The would-effect queries all need to be valid against `world.story` with no updates. They still need to be automatically reversible.

    Reversibility
    Reversibility should happen with no animation
    The key of the node affected by the forward change must be stored in order for it to be reversed.

Queries
    Update - This is very likely worth doing, but it will make the implementation of story queries a bit more complicated.

    Most queries should have an option to specify how deep they go. The default is "all the way deep", and you can clean this up semantically by filtering the results but ideally you just prevent searching that deep, more optimal.

Style/display
    - Use TypedStyle everywhere (unless it doesn't work)
    - Abstract over the --alpha-color, --rgb-color, color: rules things
    
    Revealing new text logic
        Update - this is in progress, with apply_facet_interpretation() being written but not tested. Still have to fill out some of the CSS classes used.

    TODO: Once this is confirmed to work, remove the css rules from Puffers.

        Eliminate nested class rule approach to revealing text. Instead actually add new nodes to story tree dynamically

Certain static resources- GistSpecs, StoryQuerySpecs, are shared across worlds when running multiple worlds in a single VM. There are collisions.
    Update - We need to actually run separate VMs for different worlds. One world per VM. Each world effectively needs its own entrypoint, which imports only the modules important to it/won't pollute its e.g. Gist namespace.

    This means we ought to explicitly couple a world spec with its static resources, to make this clear.

    In fact, the World Spec should just be a static resource, and globally referenceable.

    By default every world has a set of Gists and the GIST_RENDERER_DISPATCHERS is a static resource which needs to be explicitly [Seal]()'d
    
    Another thing to consider adding to this is the PUFFER_INDEX. Also, potentially a map of css classes and animations.

Because of supervenience, the world really ought to take responsibility for where undo goes, not the UI. It's a weird coupling. The world should be able to receive an "Undo" signal, and it should keep track of where to go back to in that case.

optimizations
- try using iterative instead of array map/filter
- story trees
    - hold onto a map of keys to [node, Path] at the root of each story tree
        Faster to do find_node
- parser
    - Avoid repeat walks by cloning the parser at each split
        If the repeat bits are slow, or cause a lot of gc, this could help
        Might have to ban variable reassignments to outer scopes from inside parser threads... hard to enforce
            But maybe not a huge deal, or lintable
